# Git & Github - Cheat Sheet
## The document is freely available and can be copied and distributed by all

I created this document for one course that I attended where I saw there was a need for a simple document outlining the differences between Git and GitHub and for the basic and most often used commands for commandline use of versioning control with git.

I hope it will be useful and at least give some help.

There is also a reference to a free book that is much more comprehensive.

Good luck with your git and github usage. They are great tools.
